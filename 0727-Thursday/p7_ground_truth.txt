A native, reﬅleſs, unrelenting foe,
To t down ſoftly-penve, and await
Th'approaching vior's rage; reſerv'd in chains
To grace his triumph, and become the ſcorn
Of every Roman dame—Gods! how my ſoul
Diſdains the thought! and this all ſet it free.
[Oﬀers to ﬅab her ſelf.]
PHOENISSA.
Hold, Sophonia, hold! my friend! my queen!
For whom alone I live! hold your ra point,
Nor thro' your guardian boſom ﬅab your country.
That is our laﬅ reſort, and always ſure.
The gracious gods are liberal of death;
To that laﬅ bleng lend a thouſand ways.
Think not I'd have you live to drag a chain,
And walk the triumph of inſulting Rome.
No, by theſe tears of loyalty and love!
Ere I beheld ſo vile a ght, this hand
Should urge the faithful poynard to your heart,
And glory in the deed. But, while hope lives,
Let not the generous die. 'Tis late before
The brave deſpair.
SOPHONISBA.
Thou copy of my ſoul!
And now my friend indeed! Shew me but hope,
One glimpſe of hope, and I'll renew my toils,
Call patience, labour, fortitude again,
The vext unjoyous day, and eepleſs night;
Nor rink at danger, any ape of death,
Shew me the ſmalleﬅ hope! Alas, Phœnia,
Too kindly conﬁdent! Hope lives not here,
Fled with her ﬅer Liberty beyond
The Garamantian hills, to ſome ﬅeep wild,
Some undiſcover'd country, where the foot
Of Roman cannot come.
PHOENISSA.
Yes, there e liv'd
With Mania, wounded, and forlorn,
Amidﬅ the ſerpents, hiſs, and tygers, yell.—
