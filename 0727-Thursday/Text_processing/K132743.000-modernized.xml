            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not my intention, in this preface, to defend any faults that may be found in the following piece. I am afraid there are too many: But those who are best able to discover, will be most ready to pardon them. They alone know how difficult an undertaking the writing of a tragedy is: and this is a first attempt.</p>
            <p>I beg leave only to mention the reason that determined me to make choice of this subject. What pleased me par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, tho' perhaps it will not be least liable to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection with ordinary readers, was the great simplicity of the story. It is one, regular, and uniform, not charged with a multiplicity of incidents, and yet afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing several revolutions of fortune; by which the passions may be excited, varied, and driven to their full tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of emotion</p>
            <p>This unity of design was always sought after, and admired by the antients: and the most eminent among the moderns, who understood their writings, have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to imitate them in this, from an intire conviction that the reason of it must hold good in all ages. And here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to translate a passage from the celebrated <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Racine,</hi> which contains all that I have to say on this head.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">We must not fancy that this rule has no other foundation but the caprice of those who made it. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can touch us in tragedy, but what is probable. And what probability is there, that, in one Day, should happen a multitude of things, which could scarce happen in several Weeks? There are some who think that this simplicity is a mark of barrenness of invention. But they do not consider, that, on the
<pb facs="tcp:1269801800:5"/>
contrary, invention consists in making something out of nothing: and that this huddle of incidents has always been the refuge of poets, who did not find in their genius either richness or force enough to engage their spectators, for five acts together, by a simple action, supported by the violence of passions, the beauty of sentiments, and the nobleness of expression.</q>—I would not be understood to mean that all these things are to be found in my performance: I only shew the reader what I aimed at, and how I would have pleased him, had it been in my power.</p>
            <p>As to the character of <hi>Sophonisba</hi>; in drawing it, I have confined myself to the truth of history. It were an affront to the age, to suppose such a character out of nature; especially in a country which has produced so many great examples of public spirit and heroic virtues, even in the softer sex: and I had destroyed her character intirely, had I not marked it with that strong love to her country, disdain of servitude, and inborn aversion to the <hi>Romans,</hi> by which all historians have distinguished her. Nor ought her marrying <hi>Masinissa,</hi> while her former husband was still alive, to be reckoned a blemish in her character. For, by the laws both of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> the captivity of the husband dissolved the marriage of course; as among us impotence, or adultery: not to mention the reasons of a moral and public nature, which I have put into her own mouth in the scene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt her and <hi>Syphax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is all I have to say of the play itself. But I cannot conclude without owning my obligations to those concerned in the representation. They have indeed done me more than justice. Whatever was designed as amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and engaging in <hi>Masinissa</hi> shines out in Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi>'s action. Mrs. <hi>Oldfield,</hi> in the character of <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> has excelled what, even in the fondness of an author, I could either wish or imagine. The grace, dignity, and happy variety of her action have been universally applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and are truly admirable.</p>

               <l>WHEN learning, after the long <hi>Gothic</hi> night,</l>
               <l>Fair, o'er the western world, renew'd his light,</l>
               <l>With arts arising <hi>Sophonisba</hi> rose:</l>
               <l>The tragic muse, returning, wept her woes.</l>
               <l>With her th' <hi>Italian</hi> scene first learnt to glow;</l>
               <l>And the first tears for her were taught to flow.</l>
               <l>Her charms the <hi>Gallic</hi> muses next inspir'd:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Corneille</hi> himself saw, wonder'd, and was fir'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What foreign theatres with pride have shewn,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Britain,</hi> by juster title, makes her own.</l>
               <l>When freedom is the cause, 'tis hers to fight;</l>
               <l>And hers, wken freedom is the theme, to write.</l>
               <l>For this, a <hi>British Author</hi> bids again</l>
               <l>The heroine rise, to grace the <hi>British</hi> scene.</l>
               <l>Here, as in life, she breathes her genuine flame:</l>
               <l>She asks what bosom has not felt the same?</l>
               <l>Asks of the <hi>British Youth</hi>—Is silence there?</l>
               <l>She dares to ask it of the <hi>British Fair.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To night, our home-spun author would be true,</l>
               <l>At once, to nature, history, and you.</l>
               <l>Well-pleas'd to give our neighbours due applause,</l>
               <l>He owns their learning, but disdains their laws.</l>
               <l>Not to his patient touch, or happy flame,</l>
               <l>'Tis to his <hi>British</hi> heart he trusts for fame.</l>
               <l>If <hi>France</hi> excel him in one free-born thought,</l>

                     <l>What with admiration</l>
                     <l>Struck every heart, was this—A noble virgin,</l>
                     <l>Conspicuous far o'er all the captive dames,</l>
                     <l>Was mark'd the general's prize. She wept, and blush'd,</l>
                     <l>Young, fresh, and blooming like the morn. An eye,</l>
                     <l>As when the blue sky trembles thro' a cloud</l>
                     <l>Of purest white. A secret charm combin'd</l>
                     <l>Her features, and infus'd enchantment thro' them.</l>
                     <l>Her shape was harmony.—But eloquence</l>
                     <l>Beneath her beauty fails; which seem'd, on purpose,</l>
                     <l>Pour'd out by lavish nature, that mankind</l>
                     <l>Might see this action in its highest lustre.</l>
                     <l>Soft, as she pass'd along, with downcast eyes,</l>
                     <l>Where gentle sorrow swell'd, and now and then</l>
                     <l>Dropt o'er her modest cheek a trickling tear,</l>
                     <l>The <hi>Roman</hi> legions languish'd; and hard war</l>
                     <l>Felt more than pity. Even <hi>Scipio</hi>'s self,</l>
                     <l>As on his high tribunal rais'd he sat,</l>
                     <l>Turn'd from the piercing sight, and chiding ask'd</l>
                     <l>His officers, if by this gift they meant</l>
                     <l>To cloud his glory in its very dawn.</l>

And can'st thou think, oh! canst thou think to leave me?</l>
                     <l>Expos'd, defenceless, wretched, here alone?</l>
                     <l>A prey to <hi>Romans</hi> flush'd with blood and conquest?</l>
                     <l>The subject of their scorn or baser love?</l>

                     <l>'Tis awful all, the wonderous work of fate.</l>
                     <l>But ah! this sudden marriage damps my soul;</l>
                     <l>I like it not, that wild precipitance</l>
                     <l>Of youth, that ardor, that impetuous stream</l>
                     <l>In which his love return'd. At first, my friend,</l>
                     <l>He vainly rag'd with disappointed love;</l>
                     <l>And, as the hasty storm subsided, then</l>
                     <l>To softness varied, to returning fondness,</l>
                     <l>To sighs, to tears, to supplicating vows;</l>
                     <l>But all his vows were idle, till at last</l>
                     <l>He shook my heart by <hi>Rome.</hi>—To be his queen,</l>
                     <l>Could only save me from their horrid power.</l>
                     <l>And there is madness in that thought, enough</l>
                     <l>In that strong thought alone to make me run</l>

                     <l>Just as we hop'd? just as our wishes plan'd?</l>
                     <l>Nor let your spirit sink. Your serious hours,</l>

                     <l>In all its glory, virtuous, wise and great,</l>

                     <l>All that is well. I here observ'd the king,</l>

                     <l>There is not much to fear. The dangerous spirit,</l>
                     <l>Still not unworthy fear, our matchless prize,</l>
                     <l>Is his imperious queen, is <hi>Sophonisba.</hi>

                     <l>It were as hopeful answering for the winds,</l>

            <byline>By a FRIEND.</byline>
            <stage>Spoken by Mrs. <hi>CIBBER.</hi>
            </stage>
            <lg>
               <l>NOW, I'm afraid, the modest taste in vogue</l>
               <l>Demands a strong, high-season'd epilogue.</l>
               <l>Else might some silly soul take pity's part,</l>
               <l>And odious virtue sink into the heart.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Our squeamish author scruples this proceeding;</l>
               <l>He says it hurts sound morals, and good breeding:</l>
               <l>Nor <hi>Sophonisba</hi> would he here produce,</l>
               <l>A glaring model, of no private use.</l>
               <l>Ladies, he bid me say, behold your <hi>Cato.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>What tho' no <hi>Stoic</hi> she, nor read in <hi>Plato?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Yet sure she offer'd, for her country's sake,</l>
               <l>A sacrifice, which <hi>Cato</hi> could not make—</l>
               <l>—Already, now, these wicked men are sneering,</l>
               <l>Some wresting what one says, and others leering.</l>
               <l>I vow they have not strength for—public spirit.</l>
               <l>That, ladies, must be your superior merit.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Mercy forbid! we should lay down our lives;</l>
               <l>Like these old, <hi>Punic,</hi> barbarous, heathen wives.</l>
               <l>Spare <hi>christian</hi> blood.—But sure the devil's in her,</l>
               <l>Who for her country would not lose a pinner.</l>
               <l>—Lard! how could such a creature shew her face?</l>
               <l>How?—Just as you do there—thro' <hi>Brussels</hi> Lace.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Roman</hi> fair, the public in distress,</l>
               <l>Gave up the dearest ornaments of dress.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1269801800:84"/>
How much more cheaply might you gain applause?</l>
               <l>—One yard of <hi>Ribban,</hi> and two ells of <hi>Gause.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And <hi>Gause</hi> each deep-read critic must adore;</l>
               <l>Your <hi>Roman</hi> ladies dress'd in <hi>Gause</hi> all o'er.</l>
               <l>Should you, fair patriots, come to dress so thin;</l>
               <l>How clear might all your—sentiments be seen.</l>
               <l>To foreign looms no longer owe your charms;</l>
               <l>Nor make their trade more fatal than their arms.</l>
               <l>Each <hi>British</hi> dame, who courts her country's praise,</l>
               <l>By quitting these <hi>outlandish</hi> modes, might raise</l>
               <l>(Not from yon powder'd band, so thin, and spruce)</l>
               <l>Ten able-bodied men, for—public use.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But now a serious word about the play.—</l>

               <l>Ye generous <hi>Britons!</hi> your own sons inspire;</l>
               <l>Let your applauses fan their native fire.</l>
               <l>Then other <hi>Shakespears</hi> yet may rouze the stage,</l>
